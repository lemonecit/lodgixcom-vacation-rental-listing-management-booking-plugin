Questions?

If you have any questions about Lodgix or the plugin or just need some help, please feel free to [submit a support ticket](http://support.lodgix.com)
or [read our documentation.](http://docs.lodgix.com)


== Installation ==

1. Install and Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
2. Next go to the settings page for the plugin. 
3. Enable the test credentials or enter your Lodgix.com account credentials
4. Click the "Save and Regenerate Pages" button at the bottom of the settings page

All of the pages should now have been generated.  The remaining items are:

1. Testing the pages to see if they worked well with your plugin

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to have the Thesis framework installed to use the Lodgix.com vacation rental management plug-in? =

No, the Thesis framework is not mandated to use the plugin.  An option is provided within the plugin settings for Thesis compatibility.

= What is required to setup the plug-in effectively? =

You will need to obtain a [Google Maps API Key](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html).   

Additionally the plugin does require a Lodgix.com account. The object of the plugin
is NOT to create a self sufficient vacation rental management and booking application within WordPress.

The object of the plug-in is to allow Lodgix.com customers to quickly and easily sync and display their property inventory on their 
website.  It really is a sweet plugin that will allow a property owner or designer with WordPress knowledge to build a complete
vacation rental website in a couple hours.
