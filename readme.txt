== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to have the Thesis framework installed to use the Lodgix.com vacation rental management plug-in? =

No, the Thesis framework is not mandated to use the plugin.  An option is provided within the plugin settings for Thesis compatibility.

= What is required to setup the plug-in effectively? =

You will need to obtain a [Google Maps API Key](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html).   

Additionally the plugin does require a Lodgix.com account. The object of the plugin
is NOT to create a self sufficient vacation rental management and booking application within WordPress.

The object of the plug-in is to allow Lodgix.com customers to quickly and easily sync and display their property inventory on their 
website.  It really is a sweet plugin that will allow a property owner or designer with WordPress knowledge to build a complete
vacation rental website in a couple hours.
